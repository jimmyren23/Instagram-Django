# Instagram-Lite V 1.2

I created a web application using Django that can securely create accounts, make and delete posts with images and text, and comment and like othersâ€™ posts. This stores user and Instagram post information using SQL.

# Motivation

This is my fake verison of instagram! I wanted to work with Django and create a basic program that allowed me to work with MySQL and web programming.

# Technologies Used

Django, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript

# How to Use
Instructions: To run this, you must be in you own updated Python 3 shell and Django 3 to run the server! Everything is run on the most up to date software (as of 1/22/21). Once you run 'python manage.py runserver' when you are at the directory, it should begin to run!

# Features
I have implemented the basic features such as:
  - adding posts with pictures and captions
  - letting user's create an account with password resets
  - viewing your own or all posts
  - adding likes and comments
  - deleting posts

I'm unsure of any bugs, but I have pretty much tested every feature that I had to see if anything would be buggy.
