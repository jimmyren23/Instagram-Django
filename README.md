Instructions: To run this, you must be in you own updated Python 3 shell and Django 3 to run the server! Everything is run on the most up to date software (as of 6/2/20). Once you run 'python manage.py runserver' when you are at the directory, it should begin to run!


Description: This is my fake verison of instagram! I have implemeneted the basic features such as adding posts, letting user's create an account, viewing your own or all posts, etc. I have also added on some css style pages, with some of the code being taken from w3-schools. While I didn't really style it the exact way I wanted to with some lacking of documentation, I focused on getting more features on the program such as having a forgot password section, adding likes, letting users upload images with their posts, and having users being able to comment on other's images. 

I'm unsure of any bugs, but I have pretty much tested every feature that I had to see if anything would be buggy.

The assignment was pretty fun to actually do, and it's been a while since I've done much web dev and starting Django for the first time was a blast.
