This is my fake verison of instagram! I have implemeneted the basic features such as adding posts, letting user's create an account, viewing your own or all posts, etc. I have also added on some css style pages, with some of the code being taken from w3-schools. While I didn't really style it the exact way I wanted to, I focused on getting more features on the program such as having a forgot password section, adding likes, letting users upload images with their posts, and having users being able to comment on other's images.  

I'm unsure of any bugs, but I have pretty much tested every feature that I had t
o see if anything would be buggy. Thanks!
